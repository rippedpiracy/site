It means someone has access to a release within an hour after it was pred. </p> <p><strong>0day [1]</strong></p> <p>As in 0day access to a release. It means someone has access to a release within a day after it was pred. </p> <p><strong>0day [2]</strong></p> <p>As in 0day which refers to software, videos, music, or information released or obtained on the day of public release. </p> <p><strong>1337</strong></p> <p>Leetspeak (1337) is a digital language used by gamers but it's also in the scene. </p> <p><strong>256MS, 512MS, 1GB and 2GB</strong></p> <p>These tags only apply to PSP releases, and they show the required size of an UMD disc. UMD discs can contain up to 2 gigabytes. When a game is 100mb it fits on every UMD disc, but when a game is 900mb it will only fit on 1GB and higher UMD discs. </p> <p><strong>Abandonware</strong></p> <p>Software that is no longer marketed or distributed by the company that created it. It's free from copyright. </p> <p><strong>Addline</strong></p> <p>A textline containing registration information which is used for adding someone to a site. Most common addline format is site gadduser @. </p> <p><strong>Affiliate</strong></p> <p>A release group can be an affiliate at a site. This means that they will pre their releases at that site. </p> <p><strong>AIO</strong></p> <p>AIO stands for All-In-One, meaning an all-in-one software pack. For example Microsoft Office, which contains Word, Frontpage, Publisher, Access etc. </p> <p><strong>ANSI art</strong></p> <p>Similar to ASCII art, but constructed from a larger set of 256 letters, numbers, and symbols. </p> <p><strong>ASCII art</strong></p> <p>ASCII art is an artistic medium that are graphics pieced together from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII. </p> <p><strong>Backdoor</strong></p> <p>A hidden piece of software that allows it's creator to access the computer. It bypasses normal authentication to the computer system. Using the backdoor, the hacker can get remote access to the computer. The backdoor may take the form of an installed, legimate program. </p> <p><strong>Bitrate</strong></p> <p>Bitrate or Bit Rate is the average number of bits that one second of video or audio data will consume. Higher bitrate means bigger file size and generally better video or audio quality while lower bitrate means lower file size but worse video or audio quality. </p> <p><strong>BitTorrent</strong></p> <p>A special kind of Peer-to-Peer system. It uses a central location which coodinates the downloads but it doesn't host any downloads. The download itself consists of several pieces offered by various users. Such a coordinated group is called a torrent. </p> <p><strong>Blu-Ray</strong></p> <p>Blu-ray Disc is a next-generation optical disc format meant for high definition video (HD) and high density data storage, and is one of two competing standards for HD optical media. Its competitor is HD-DVD. A Blu-ray Disc can store substantially more data than a DVD, because of the blue laser. A Blu-ray dvd can hold up to 50 GB. </p> <p><strong>BNC</strong></p> <p>BNC stands for bouncer. A bouncer is a server through which a user can connect to an IRC server. This way other users on the IRC server can't see his/her real IP address. </p> <p><strong>Buffer Overflow</strong></p> <p>An error caused when a program or exploit tries to store too much data into a buffer, than the buffer can handle. This can be exploited by hackers to create and execute a backdoor, leading to system access. </p> <p><strong>CD</strong></p> <p>CD stands for CompactDisc. A CD is an one-sided disk which can hold up to 650-700Mb of data. </p> <p><strong>CDR</strong></p> <p>A recordable compact disc. </p> <p><strong>Chanserv</strong></p> <p>This is a service provided by many IRC Networks to allow you register a channel. </p> <p><strong>CLONECD / CLONEDVD</strong></p> <p>A complete image of an original cd/dvd. These images do not contain any crack, it's just a copy of an original cd/dvd. Therefore it still contains all copyright information. </p> <p><strong>Crack</strong></p> <p>Software cracking is the modification of software to remove encoded copy prevention. </p> <p><strong>Cracktro</strong></p> <p>A small introduction sequence added to cracked software, designed to inform the user which releasegroup was responsible for removing the software's copy prevention and distributing the crack. </p> <p><strong>DDoS Attack</strong></p> <p>A distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) occurs when multiple compromised systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually web server(s). These systems are compromised by attackers using a variety of methods. </p> <p><strong>Dir Locking</strong></p> <p>The act of locking a directory so people who are not allowed to get into a directory, won't be able to get in. </p> <p><strong>DoS Attack</strong></p> <p>A denial-of-service attack is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. Typically the targets are high-profile web servers, and the attack attempts to make the hosted web pages unavailable on the Internet. </p> <p><strong>Dox</strong></p> <p>Dox are single keygens/cracks/fixes etc. </p> <p><strong>DL</strong></p> <p>DL stands for Dual-Language, meaning the movie contains more than one language. Synonym ML (Multi Language). </p> <p><strong>Dump</strong></p> <p>A dump is a ftp server where releases are stored. Dumps are often faster than regular ftp servers and have a larger harddisk. Releasegroups may have a groupdump, where the group's releases are stored. Such a groupdump serves as an archive, internal exchange of releases and for spreading the group's releases. </p> <p><strong>DVD</strong></p> <p>Stands for Digital Versatile Disk (Formerly Digital Video Disk). An optic disc with the same physical size as a CD but with significantly greater storage capacity, anywhere from 4.5 Gb (single layer, single-sided) to 17 Gb storage capacity (double-layer, double sided). It uses MPEG2 compression to encode 720 480p resolution, full-motion video and Dolby Digital to encode 5.1 channels of discrete audio. The disc can also contain PCM, DTS, and MPEG audio soundtracks. </p> <p><strong>DVD5</strong></p> <p>DVD5 is an one-sided single-layer dvd disc and can contain upto 4.38 gigabytes of data on it.<br> DVD disc manufacturers love to use marketing terms and sell their discs as 4.7GB discs, but this is not true -- the 4.7GB<br> is calculated by using so-called "Japanese gigabytes", where the power of calculations is 1,000 instead of 1,024 (and 1.024 is the correct way to calculate everything in computer world -- so, 1024 megabytes = 1 gigabyte). </p> <p><strong>DVD9</strong></p> <p>DVD9 is an single-sided dual-layer dvd disc and can hold approximately 7.95 gigabytes of data. See DVD5 for an explanation about the dvd size. </p> <p><strong>Eggdrop Bots</strong></p> <p>These bots can execute scripts like site annoucements, rss output and more. </p> <p><strong>EMUDVD</strong></p> <p>Stands for EMUlation DVD. It's quite similar to CLONEDVD. You can burn the release, but in order to run it you need an emulation program running in the background such as DT4's RMPS. You can also mount the release, but its still an emulation. The scene considers any release that requires a helper program that runs in the background to bypass the protection as emulation, and thus should be named properly as emulation. The only possible exception to this rule is ATIP hiders. </p> <p><strong>Encode</strong></p> <p>Encoding is the process of converting one digital format to another, applying known algorithms to either obscure the content of the file, or to compress or convert it to another format. </p> <p><strong>Exploit</strong></p> <p>An exploit is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug, glitch or vulnerability in software in order to get access to this computer. When the exploit is succesfull, the computer hacker can gain control of the computer system to use it for a DoS attack, or running a ftp-server. </p> <p><strong>Filler</strong></p> <p>People who put releases on to a FTP-server. </p> <p><strong>Fserve</strong></p> <p>Trading system for irc which uses the mIRC client's File Server function and some scripts so users can share their warez directly from their hard drives with each other. </p> <p><strong>FTP</strong></p> <p>File Transfer Protocol. This is the protocol used for file transfers from client to server and from server to client. With a FTP application you can move/transfer files to another computer connected to the internet independent of machine type or operating systems. The FTP protocol is used in the scene for the warez servers. </p> <p><strong>FXP</strong></p> <p>FXP is the File eXchange Protocol. It isn't an actual protocol, just a method of transfer making use of a vulnerability in FTP. It allows the transfer of files between two FTP servers. </p> <p><strong>FXP Boards</strong></p> <p>People who scan/hack/fill vulnerable computers with warez. </p> <p><strong>Hammer</strong></p> <p>The act of retrying to connect to a FTP, (almost) without a timeout between the retries, when the server is full. Hammering will slow down the server and will usually result in an ip-ban. </p> <p><strong>IMG-file</strong></p> <p>An .img file is an image of a CD/DVD. An .img file can be burned directly on a cd/dvd using Alcohol 120% for example. Not supported by all burn programs. </p> <p><strong>iND</strong></p> <p>iND stands for Independent. iND is not a real group, just term to categorize users who aren't members of a releasegroup. Occasionally there are releases done by -iND. </p> <p><strong>iNTERNAL</strong></p> <p>A release is done internal when it's released for a limited amount of people. Nowadays it's mostly used when a release is already done by another group. By adding the internal tag, the release won't be nuked. </p> <p><strong>IRC</strong></p> <p>IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. IRC is a massive network of text-based chat channels and users from all across the world. </p> <p><strong>IRC Trading</strong></p> <p>Users of IRC who download from "XDCC Bots" or "Fserves". </p> <p><strong>ISO-image</strong></p> <p>An .iso file is an image of a CD/DVD. An .iso file can directly be burned to a cd/dvd using Alcohol 120% for example. </p> <p><strong>Keygen</strong></p> <p>Keygen is a program which randomly generates software keys. </p> <p><strong>Leaking</strong></p> <p>The act of leaking ftp login info to other people. </p> <p><strong>Leeching</strong></p> <p>Downloading a lot without uploading. </p> <p><strong>Mount</strong></p> <p>To create a virtual cd/dvd drive with the content of an image file. </p> <p><strong>Nickserv</strong></p> <p>This is a service provided by many IRC networks that will allow you to register a nickname to make sure no-one else steals it on you. </p> <p><strong>NFO (.nfo file)</strong></p> <p>A nfo file is a textfile with information about the release. </p> <p><strong>NTSC</strong></p> <p>The American video format standard. </p> <p><strong>OS</strong></p> <p>Operating system of a computer, such as Windows or Mac. </p> <p><strong>OST</strong></p> <p>OST stands for Original SoundTrack. An OST is a collection of music found in a particular video game, movie, TV serie, etc. </p> <p><strong>PAL</strong></p> <p>The European video format standard. </p> <p><strong>PAR-files</strong></p> <p>These files are able to reconstruct files that are missing from the archive when downloading via newsgroups. For example, if you have downloaded an archive that was split into 47 RAR files but one of them is missing, you could simply download a PAR file for that archive. Once you have the PAR file, you can use a tool such as SmartPAR to reconstruct the missing file. </p> <p><strong>Paysite</strong></p> <p>FTP servers that unofficially host Scene releases. They work as Pay-to-Leech (P2L), so if someone wanted to download something off the site they would have to pay.</p> <p><strong>Peer-To-Peer</strong></p> <p>Sharing and delivery system where users who are logged are able to download files from eachother. </p> <p><strong>PPF</strong></p> <p>A .ppf file is a patch file, used to fix bad cd/dvd's. </p> <p><strong>Pre</strong></p> <p>When a releasegroup pre's a release, it will be available for other people and the distribution will start. Also the releasename will be registered in the pre database. </p> <p><strong>Pre-database</strong></p> <p>A database with all release titles. These release titles are not for download, they are just records. Apart from the release title, a record often also contains the release size, release date, and sometimes also NFO's. With commands one is able to 'check' a release. </p> <p><strong>Pre-spam</strong></p> <p>When a release is pre'd, it will be seen by millions of people in pre-announce channels and sites. These are channels which echo every release when it's pred. Some people (pre-spammers) abuse the fact that so many people read this and they fake releases with a message as the releasename. That way the 'release' name will be seen by all these people, this is why they do it. For example, when Germany lost against Italy in the semi finals of the FIFA World Cup 2006, there were pre spam messages like Schade.Deutschland.Alles.Ist.Vobei-2006-uSuCK. Pre-spam is certainly not tolerated and pre-spammers will be punished or scenebanned. </p> <p><strong>Pre-tool</strong></p> <p>A tool releasegroups use to pre a release simultaneously at multiple sites. Thanks to the pre-tool, the releasegroup doesn't have to pre it manually on every site, this saves them time, and the release is pre'd at the same time at all sites. </p> <p><strong>Proxy</strong></p> <p>A gateway through which users can connect to the Internet. Advantage of proxy is that servers and other www-users won't be able to view the user's real ip. </p> <p><strong>Proper</strong></p> <p>Due to scene rules, whoever releases a certain release the first, has won that race. For example, when a group releases the CAM version of Titanic the first. If there is something "wrong" with the release (poor quality, out-of-sync, audio errors etc.) and another group has a better/correct version, it can release it and add PROPER to the release title to avoid being nuked. However, the source must be the same as the original release. For example A poor quality CAM release by group A and group B releases their CAM release PROPER. A Telesync release doesn't PROPER a CAM release, because the source is different. PROPER is the most subjective tag in the scene, and a lot of people will generally argue whether the PROPER is better than the original release. The reason for the PROPER should always be mentioned in the NFO. When a group 'propers' a PROPER it is tagged as REAL.PROPER. </p> <p><strong>PSXPSP</strong></p> <p>This is a PSX (Playstation 1) game playable on a PSP (Playstation Portable) using custom PSP firmware. </p> <p><strong>Pubstro</strong></p> <p>This is a computer that has been compromised and has a FTP-server running on it. It will be used to share warez, mainly to the FXP Community. </p> <p><strong>Racer</strong></p> <p>People who try to fill a release the quickest. </p> <p><strong>Raping</strong></p> <p>A FTP-server is getting raped when many people download from a FTP-server at the same time at high speeds. </p> <p><strong>Recode</strong></p> <p>A recode is a previously released movie, usually filtered through TMPGenc to remove subtitles, fix color etc. </p> <p><strong>Rehacking</strong></p> <p>The act of hacking a computer/pubstro which someone else has already hacked, and replacing his FTP-server with his own. Rehacking will often result in a ban from all FXP boards. </p> <p><strong>Release</strong></p> <p>Original releases are rips of movies, programs, games and music, all released by groups specialized in creating these kinds of releases. </p> <p><strong>Releasegroups</strong> </p> <p>Groups of people who pirate and release software, music and movies. </p> <p><strong>Repacker</strong></p> <p>Entity or Group which makes Repacks and releases them.</p> <p><strong>Repack[1]</strong></p> <p>When a Scene Group releases a fixed version of one of their older releases.</p> <p><strong>Repack[2]</strong></p> <p>A Scene Release compressed to the lightest possible, has to be installed when downloaded. </p> <p><strong>Rip</strong></p> <p>To extract or copy data from a cd/dvd to another, more useful (and smaller) format. </p> <p><strong>ROM</strong></p> <p>ROM images is used in the context of emulation for software which only runs on different hardware. These ROM images can be run on an emulator. For example, GBA rom images which are started on a GBA Emulator. Using a GBA emulator on a PC will enable the user to play GBA games on his PC. </p> <p><strong>Scanner</strong></p> <p>People who can fast IP ranges for vulnerable computers. </p> <p><strong>Scanstro</strong></p> <p>Similar to a pubstro, but it is used to scan for other vulnerable computers. </p> <p><strong>Sceneban</strong></p> <p>An individual or a group of people can be banned from the scene, because they did something seriously wrong. For example when someone appears to be a fed. </p> <p><strong>SE</strong></p> <p>SE stands for Special Edition. Like the name says, it's a special dvd edition of a movie. Often special editions contain extra material like deleted scenes, interviews, or a making-of. </p> <p><strong>Serial</strong></p> <p>A serial is a key for software. This unique key works as an extra security. </p> <p><strong>SFCLONECD / SFCLONEDVD</strong></p> <p>Same as CLONECD/DVD, but the disc's protection is Star Force. StarForce blocks the use of SCSI optical drives when IDE optical drives are present in the system, since most optical drive emulators currently work by simulating SCSI drives. StarForce, however, will authenticate discs from a SCSI optical disc drive if there are no IDE optical disc drives installed in the system; meaning that if you want to run this disc you'll have to unplug your harddisks in order to run the mounted cd or dvd image. </p> <p><strong>SFV-file (.sfv)</strong></p> <p>SFV stands for Simple File Validator and is used to check files if they became corrupt after transfer. It does this by doing a CRC (cyclic redundancy check). After the check it displays which files contain CRC-errors and therefore are corrupt. It's also used on FTP servers / sites to check the progress of downloads or uploads. Click here to read more about sfv-files. </p> <p><strong>Site Ops</strong></p> <p>Site Operators are people who are the administrator of a site. </p> <p><strong>Site Trading</strong></p> <p>The act of trading releases between sites. </p> <p><strong>Sites</strong></p> <p>Very fast FTP servers with people who trade the releases by releasegroups to other (top)sites. </p> <p><strong>SQL Injection</strong></p> <p>A type of exploit whereby hackers are able to execute SQL statements via an Internet browser. </p> <p><strong>SSL</strong></p> <p>SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. SSL is an application layer protocol created by Netscape for managing the security of message transmissions in a network. SSL uses the public-and-private key encryption system from RSA, which also includes the use of a digital certificate. Sites require SSL to connect to them, this is more safe since the transmissions are encrypted. </p> <p><strong>Topsites</strong></p> <p>Very fast FTP servers with people who trade the releases by releasegroups to other (top)sites. </p> <p><strong>Torrent</strong></p> <p>A special kind of p2p system. It uses a central location which coodinates the downloads but it doesn't host any downloads. The download itself consists of several pieces offered by various users. Such a coordinated group is called a torrent. </p> <p><strong>Trainer</strong></p> <p>Trainers are programs made to modify behaviour of a computer game in order to allow cheating. Usually trainers contain such features as god mode, unlimited ammo and others that sometimes aren't pre-programmed into the game by its designers. Applying the trainer is similar to applying a regular patch. </p> <p><strong>UE</strong></p> <p>UE stands for Ultra Edition, it's just another commercial name for a special dvd release similar to SE. </p> <p><strong>UMDRip</strong></p> <p>This applies only to Playstation Portable (PSP) games, and it means that some stuff was ripped from the original game because it was not required or was ripped to save space. For example languages or movie files. </p> <p><strong>USA, JAP, EUR</strong></p> <p>Especially PSP releases, but also other console releases, are sometimes tagged as USA, JAP and EUR. These are alternative regions, and they replace PAL and NTSC. USA are off course the United States of America, JAP is Japan and EUR is Europe. </p> <p><strong>Warez</strong></p> <p>Illegally pirated software, movies or music. </p> <p><strong>XDCC</strong></p> <p>Hacked computer which serves as a file server for irc so people can download from it.</p> <p><sub>credits: <a href="https://gazellegames.net/wiki.php?action=article&id=94" target=_blank>https://gazellegames.net/wiki.php?action=article&amp;id=94</a></sub></p> <footer> <div class=inline> <b><p class=article-info>Last updated: <span class="git-revision-date-localized-plugin git-revision-date-localized-plugin-date" title="July 31, 2022 13:20:38 UTC">July 31, 2022</span></p></b> </div> <div style="float: right; margin-top: 0.1em;"> <p class=article-info> <a href=https://github.com/rippedpiracy/docs/blob/master/Scene/Scene-Glossary.md target=_blank> <strong>Contribute on</strong> <img src=/pix/github.svg alt=Github> </a> </p> </div> </footer> </section> </main> <a id=darkmodetoggle onclick=switchTheme()><img src=/pix/dark_mode.svg alt="Dark Mode Toggle"></a> <a id=ico-disc href=https://discord.ripped.guide><img src=/pix/discord.svg alt=Discord></a> <a href=https://github.com/rippedpiracy/ id=ico-gh><img src=/pix/github.svg alt=GitHub></a> </body> </html>
