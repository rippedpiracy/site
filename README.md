# Ripped Piracy

Replacement for the #trusted-sites channel in the [Ripped Discord](https://discord.ripped.guide).

If you **do** suggest something, please keep note that it:
- needs to be a trusted and safe site.
- cannot host other illegal content like company leaks.
- cannot be a single download link.
- has to be hosted on the clearnet.

# How do I contribute?

Easily head over to the [**docs**](https://github.com/rippedpiracy/docs) repo and make an issue or a Pull Request.
