description: Where to get Games from safely and efficiently.

## General Torrent

**[1337x](https://1337x.to) (Torrent)**

A very popular Torrenting site which has an incredible amount of content, but also have major downsides including a bad moderation team in general (not banning uploaders who have uploaded Malware in the past) and an *incredibly* unsafe Software category (Don't get Software Releases apart from Games off this site).  
**_Note: Stay away from Torrents marked IGGGAMES, xGIROx, Seyter, Qoob, nosTEAM, CorePack, crackshash, Crackzsoft and SadeemPC._**  
**_Note: 1337x has a lot of fake and mirror sites, you should only use the one we linked._**

**[Rarbg](https://rarbg.to) (Torrent)**

A very safe site to get Games from, mostly Scene Releases which they have auto uploading Bots for. If you use a VPN get ready to solve CAPTCHAs.  
**_Note: As this is also a very famous Torrent Tracker, only use it's original link._**

## Repackers

**[FitGirl](https://fitgirl-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

One of the most well known and reputable Repackers out there, very active and provides Torrent links with DDL mirrors. Only downside being the Repacks can take a long time to install depending on your hardware.  
**_Note: FitGirl also has a lot of fake sites which spread Malware, only use the original linked here and her uploads on 1337x/etc._**

**[DODI](https://dodi-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

Another active Repacker that provides Torrent links with DDL mirrors. Usually takes shorter to install compared to FitGirl while having ever so slightly bigger Releases.

**[Masquerade](https://masquerade.site) (DDL / Torrent)**

A known Repacker that focuses more on indie titles. Mostly uses Google Drive as the main downloading option and Torrents on his newer Releases.

**[XATAB](https://xatab-repack.com) (Torrent)**

One of the oldest and most respected Repacker that past away recently. His site is currently reposting from other sources but his older Releases can still be found here. **RIP 196X - 2021.**

## Mirrorers

**[Ova Games](https://ovagames.com) (DDL)**

A site which focuses on reuploading Repacks, P2P Cracks, Scene Releases and GOG Rips to multiple hosts. They rarely include Torrent links. They take requests.

**[CrackHub](https://crackhub.site) (DDL)**

Another site that mainly focuses on reuploading to different hosts, they take requests. It also has an automatic Scene upload Bot which uploads to zippyshare [found here](https://scene.crackhub.site).

**[GamesDrive](https://gamesdrive.net) (DDL)**

Another site that reuploads Repacks, P2P Cracks and Scene Releases to various hosts.

## Forums

**[CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum) (DDL)**

Arguably the best site for Steam Piracy. It's a well moderated Forum with active members. Not only good for getting Games from, but also learning about different Cracking tools. They rarely upload torrents. Requires Sign-up.

**[Torrminatorr](https://forum.torrminatorr.com) (DDL)**

Another well moderated Forum with active uploaders and discussions that allow Scene uploads (contrary of CS.RIN.RU), GOG Rips, Retro Games and even Linux Games. Requires Sign-up.

## Misc

**[Online-Fix](https://online-fix.me) (DDL / Torrent)**

Any Cracked Game that have multiplayer unlocked (usually on Steam) you will most likely find it here done by their own internal Cracker 0xdeadc0de. Note: Their site has strong measures against Ad-blockers. Requires Sign-up.

**[F95zone](https://f95zone.to/) & [U18-Chan](https://u18chan.com/a/) (DDL)**

Big Forums for **_Adult Games_**. F95zone mainly focuses on **_Eroges_** while U18-Chan focuses more on **Yiff Games**.

**[Nyaa](https://nyaa.si) & [Sukebei](https://sukebei.nyaa.si) (Torrent)**

Both are good sources for popular Visual Novels and Japanese Games while the latter is more for **_NSFW titles_**.

## Glossary 

**DDL:** Direct Download, where you can download a file from a server usually by your browser.  
**Torrent:** A decentralised Peer-to-Peer file sharing protocol that is very common when sharing Pirated Content since the file isnt on a single server that can easily be taken down. We recommend using [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) as a BitTorrent client.  
**Repacks:** Highly compressed Games that usually include all released DLCs, language packs, are pre-cracked and require minimal Piracy knowledge. Good for beginners and people that have low Internet bandwidth.
