## Wait, what is a PreDB?

As listed in the [**Scene Glossary**](https://ripped.guide/Scene/scene-glossary/),

> A database with all release titles. These release titles are not for download, they are just records. 

> Apart from the release title, a record often also contains the release size, release date, and sometimes also NFO's. 

> With commands one is able to 'check' a release.

That said, here's some Pre-Database sites to check for releases.

## Honorable Mention
**[CrackWatch](https://crackwatch.com/)**

Instead of being a automatic feed, Crackwatch has user-submitted releases with their only focus being Games.
